## Reasons for exclusion {.tabset}
How to read this plot: The horizontal green bars show for how many women this reason for
exclusion applies. The blue bars show how many women are excluded for multiple reasons (e.g.,
they're menopausal _and_ not heterosexual).

### Table
```{r}
exclusion_reasons = all_surveys %>% 
  mutate(reasons_for_exclusion = str_sub(reasons_for_exclusion, 1, -3)) %>% 
  select(session, reasons_for_exclusion) %>% 
  comma_separated_to_columns(reasons_for_exclusion) %>% 
  select(-session) 

exclusion_reasons %>%

  knitr::kable()

### Figure 3: Exclusion criteria and most common combinations of exclusion criteria. {.active}
The horizontal green bars show for how many women this exclusion criteria applies. The blue bars show how many women are excluded for multiple reasons (e.g., not finishing the initial survey and being pregnant). Only the 20 most common overlaps are displayed. See Figure S1 in the supplementary materials for all combinations.
